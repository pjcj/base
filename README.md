# My Base System

This is the base system that I put onto any machine on which I am developing.
It includes config files for:

* [notion](notion.sourceforge.net)
* Xdefaults, including [urxvt](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode)
* [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)
* [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)
* vim
* powerline
* git
